What is "StepZero" all about?

Before you get started on any project there's preparation and knowledge anyone needs.  Put simply, before you can complete step one, you have to complete step zero.

Step zero can comprise of the things you should know before getting started on any open source project.  These include:

   * how to behave
   * how to use IRC
   * what is whitespace and why it matters
   * how to write a bug report
and so on

"StepZero" began when of a seasoned veteran of the OS community encouraged a writer who was trying to get involved in OS projects.  It became apparent that OS projects often made certain assumptions when it came to the baseline knowledge most OS contributors possess.  

The veteran tried to explain to the writer some of the more basic concepts and from that it became clear there is probably a need for some place to record these basic concepts.  

We needed a place to record what comprised step zero of getting involved in OS.

And here we are.
